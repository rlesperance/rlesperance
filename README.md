- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rlesperance
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in python as it relates to GIS, specifically ArcGIS development.  
- ðŸŒ± Currently I work for Esri as a consultant, so this is as much a repository as a place to organize my own scripting and explore what other people have done. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:  rlesperance@esri.com
